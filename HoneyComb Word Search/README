This is a HoneyComb Word Search program. It finds all possible words in a honeycomb that are also contained in a dictionary and outputs them
in alphabetical order.

This program contains the following files:

BuildHoneyComb.java		InputGen.class
CellStructure.java		InputGen.java
CombStructure.java		MyTrie.java
Direction.java			Point.java
HoneyCombWordSearch.java
README

HoneyCombWordSearch.java is main file for the program. It requires two arguments and outputs to stdout. 

InputGen is a java file that takes one argument - the number of layers in the honeycomb, and generates a random .txt
file that can be used to create a HoneyComb. This was used for testing. 

Some benchmarks regarding testing are shown below:
Each of these tests were done with a dictionary of ~ 45000 words
The test benchmarks were carried out on a Linux Machine

1. On 250 layered HoneyComb: ~ 2600 milliseconds
2. On 500 layered HoneyComb: ~ 9000 milliseconds
3. On 1000 layered HoneyComb: ~ 40000 milliseconds
4. On 1500 layered HoneyComb: ~ 90526 milliseconds 

In analysis, the algorithm takes, overall, O(n^2) in terms of time complexity in the number of layers. 

Thank you!
